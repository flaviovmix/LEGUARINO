    <h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
    
    <p>CVE-2024-47072: XStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to stack overflow from a manipulated
	binary input stream.</p>
    
    <h2 id="affected_versions">Affected Versions</h2>
    
    <p>All versions until and including version 1.4.20 are affected, if using XStream's BinaryStreamDriver.</p>

    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    
    <p>XStream provides a BinaryStreamDriver with an own optimized serialization format.  The format uses ids for
	string values as deduplication.  The mapping for these ids are created on-the-fly at marshalling time.  At
	unmarshalling time the reader's implementation simply used a simple one-time recursion after reading a mapping
	token to process the next normal token of the data stream.  However, an endless recursion could be triggered with
	manipulated input data resulting in a stack overflow causing a denial of service.</p>

    <h2 id="reproduction">Steps to Reproduce</h2>

    <p>Prepare the manipulated data and provide it as input for a XStream instance using the BinaryDriver:</p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>final byte[] byteArray = new byte[36000];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; byteArray.length / 4; i++) {
      byteArray[i * 4] = 10;
      byteArray[i * 4 + 1] = -127;
      byteArray[i * 4 + 2] = 0;
      byteArray[i * 4 + 3] = 0;
}

XStream xstream = new XStream(new BinaryStreamDriver());
xstream.fromXML(new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArray));
</pre></div>

    <p>As soon as the data gets unmarshalled, the endless recursion is entered and the executing thread is aborted with
	a stack overflow error.</p>

    <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

    <p>The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting
    in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream if the instance is setup with a
	BinaryStreamDriver.</p>

    <h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2>

	<p>A simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.  There's no other known
	workaround when using the BinaryStreamDriver.</p>

    <p>Alexis Challande of Trail Of Bits found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.</p>
